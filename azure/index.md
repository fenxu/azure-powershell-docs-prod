# Get started with Azure PowerShell cmdlets
This guide is the introduction to the Cmdlet Reference for Windows Azure PowerShell.In it, you’ll find everything you need to get up and running quickly with the cmdlets.

Azure PowerShell cmdlets provide support for the following Azure services:

[Azure Resource Manager](./blob/master/azureps-cmdlets-docs/ResourceManager/index.md)
Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group.You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.

[Azure Service Management](./blob/master/azureps-cmdlets-docs/ServiceManagement/index.md)
Azure Service Management helps you manage your deployments, hosted services, and storage accounts.

[Azure Storage](./blob/master/azureps-cmdlets-docs/Storage/index.md)
Azure Storage is the cloud storage solution for modern applications that rely on durability, availability, and scalability to meet your needs.Storage supports Blob storage, File storage, Queue storage, and Table storage.

[Azure Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/servicefabric)
Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. Service Fabric addresses significant challenges in developing and managing cloud applications.By using Service Fabric, developers and administrators can avoid solving complex infrastructure problems and focus instead on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads knowing that they are scalable, reliable, and manageable.

[Azure Elastic Database Jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/elasticdatabasejobs/v0.8.33/elasticdatabasejobs)
Elastic Database Jobs enables you to run a Transact-SQL script or apply a data-tier application package across a group of Azure SQL databases.By using these cmdlets, perform administrative operations such as schema changes, credentials management, reference data updates, performance data collection, and tenant telemetry collection.

[Azure Information Protection: Azure Rights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/aadrm%20module/vlatest/rightsmanagement)
The Azure PowerShell cmdlets for Azure RMS let you administer Azure RMS from the command line.Although this enables automation, it also supports reliable and repeated processes to help reduce administrative overheads.

[Azure Information Protection: Azure Rights Management data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/rmsprotection%20module/vlatest/rightsprotection)
You can use the RMS Protection cmdlets with Azure Rights Management data protection from Azure Information Protection, or with Active Directory Rights Management Services.Use these RMS Protection cmdlets to bulk protect and unprotect files for any file type.

## Start
To use these cmdlets, you should have a good understanding of PowerShell and how it works.And experience with Microsoft Azure, since the cmdlets you will use perform the same functions available through the portal GUI.

You’ll also need to know basic PowerShell scripting techniques since this guide doesn’t teach you how to script, but instead shows you how to use the cmdlets to automate common IT administration tasks.

If you are new to Azure, see [the Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/#).

If you need to brush up on PowerShell before you get started, see [Scripting with Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx).And watch this video: [PowerShell Basics: (Part 1) Getting Started with PowerShell](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Taste-of-Premier/PowerShellBasicsPart1).

## About Azure cmdlets
